    <string name="description">MQTT Patterns. This application provides a simple implementation of an MQTT client capable of one connection at the time, publishing and multiple subscriptions to any given topic. \n \n
        It supports only a single CA file for SSL/TLS as of this version, however, work is in progress to add a client private key and certificate.</string>
